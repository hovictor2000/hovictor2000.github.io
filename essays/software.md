WORK IN PROGRESS
For the past few months, I have been learning the ins and outs of software engineering through my software engineering class. Honestly, it has been a journey, and I wanted to share my experience going through it all. 

## The Stack

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The software engineering class that I took was focused on full stack development. This meant learning about technologies like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, MongoDB, and a bunch of other useful frameworks. This was definitely not easy to do as my computer sciences before were primarily focused on a singular language, like C or Java, whereas here you have to learn the entire stack. However, despite these technologies being very prominent and used by millions of people, I feel that learning these technologies was not the most important thing that I learned in this class.

## The Process

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, I have found the lessons about the processes of software engineering to be the most insightful. After all, the most important part about hiring a software engineer is the person, not the languages/frameworks they know. The hottest new languages and frameworks always change, but learning about the processes of software engineering is something that is always going to be relevant. Some highlights include learning about agile project management. Agile project management has a very high emphasis on delivering results swiftly, and it is done by setting concrete milestones that require something is deliverable at the end of the milestone, which can be periods of 7-14 days. This is done with fairly frequent meetings to determine progress and figure out which issues to prioritize. Then each team member will choose their own issues to focus on and attempt to complete before the milestone. This allows the most important issues to be addressed, and allows the team to adapt easily to new issues and address them appropriately, or in other words, be agile! Learning about this was super insightful as it taught me how software teams are able to deliver products so fast.

## The Final Project

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once we neared the end of the semester, we were assigned a final project that really tested whether or not we can apply the things we learned in this class. WORK IN PROGRESS
  
## The Future?
