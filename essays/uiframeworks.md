This week I have been lucky enough to learn about web design in my software engineering class. Last week we learned about HTML/CSS, and as someone who has only learned more backend technologies such as Java or Python, learning the technologies that make up the websites I use everyday has been very eye opening. Now we are learning about UI frameworks, with exercises in Semantic finishing up this week, and a React module coming in the next.

## UI Frameworks
After doing some work in HTML and CSS, I definitely feel like learning at least one UI framework is worth the time. Raw HTML and CSS will let you create anything you need for a website, but using a UI framework simplifies it immensely, which eventually makes the time invested in learning one worth it. One example of this is how much easier it becomes to create a navigation bar. With raw HTML and CSS, you have to create your own ```div``` class and figure out all the extra features you want. However with a framework like Semantic, you can just specify the specific type of navigation bar that you want, and it will have its own class that will do most of the work for you. For example, for an assignment I needed a black navigation bar on the top that is fixed and has four items, and all I needed to do when using Semantic was make a ```div``` with ```ui fixed top inverted four item menu``` as its class, and I got exactly what I wanted. Meanwhile, a similar navigation bar that I had to create for a seperate assignment was both harder to program, and a lot less visually appealing.
