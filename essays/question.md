  Learning how to code is difficult, and the learning never stops. That is why it is very common to become stuck while writing a piece of code. Luckily for everyone, Stack Overflow is a great online forum that is full of smart people who are happy to take time out of their day to help you with your issues. However their help is not guaranteed, and even if it was, it might not be effective unless you make sure you asked your question smartly.

## Smart Questions

  The core principle being asking smart questions is simple. If you can make your question easy to read and understand, people are more likely to help, and the help that they give is more likely to be helpful. To do this, there are three simple steps. The first step is to make sure that your question is actually smart, and this is done by searching up your issue/question online. There are millions of programmers worldwide, and chances are there was at least someone who ran into the same issue as you, and hopefully they were able to find some help that you'll be able to look at. The second step is to state your issue clearly and concisely. When developers on Stack Overflow with the intention to help others, they don't want to spend 30 minutes figuring out what you're even asking. That's why you have to be clear about what went wrong, and what you want to happen. The third and final step is to list all the things you've already tried. No one wants to help someone who is just looking for an easy answer, and no one wants to reinvent the wheel by suggesting fixes that you already attempted. Listing everything that you've already tried will get rid of redundant answers and lead to you receiving much better answers.
