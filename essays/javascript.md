Last weekend in my software engineering class, we were given the task of learning the syntax of JavaScript over the weekend. Here's my thoughts of both the language, and the "Atheletic Software Engineering" approach that's behind all of this.



## JavaScript
The syntax of JavaScript was really straightforward, it felt like a middle ground between Python and Java. The way you format and write most of your code is similar to Java since they are both heavily influenced by C style syntax, but similar to Python, you don't have to worry about your variable types when declaring a variable, or adding to an array. JavaScript objects also look a lot like the Python dictionaries that I'm familiar with, so that helped me a lot in understanding them. However that's where the similarities stop. Unlike Python variables, you still have to declare variables with a keyword, usually ``` let ``` , sometimes ``` const ```, and you don't talk about ``` var ```. Also functions are first class, meaning that unlike many other languages, you can actually pass and return functions. Even with my tiny amount of experience and understanding of the language I can tell that this is very powerful. I have had many experiences in the past with other languages where I wanted to send the results of a function to another function, but since functions weren't first class, I would have to first save the result in a variable, then pass it, which always felt absolutely awful to do.
