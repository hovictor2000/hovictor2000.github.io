## The Past
If you were to ask my high school self what job field I wanted to get into, computer science probably would not have come up. Back then, I viewed computer science and programming in general as this obtrusive subject where learning a programming language is akin to actually learning a normal language with conjugations and grammar. It wasn't until I gave computer science a chance in my sophomore year of college that I fell in love with coding.
## The Present
In reality programming is the opposite of normal written/spoken languages. Instead of memorizing countless words and grammar rules, programming is more about using logic to figure out an implementation, and then using the syntax of the programming language of choice to implement your idea. When I realizd this, my interest in computer science bloomed as problem solving one of the main reasons behind my decision to major in math. 

## The Future
While I decided that I wanted to go into the field of computer science, I'm still undecided on the specifics. Analyzing data and drawing conclusions from it is something that I really enjoy so I'm heavily considering data science, but I also love the feeling and satisfaction of creating things, which leans more towards being a software engineer. While it's true that the choice isn't binary, as going into data science doesn't mean you never create anything, and software engineering is very intertwined with data, it still affects the skills and experiences that I'll target in the rest of my college career. For now, going forward I plan on getting more experience with both software engineering and data science so that I can learn more about the nuances of the two fields before commiting to one.
